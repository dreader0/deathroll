# deathroll

deathroll is a fast-paced and easy to pick up drinking game inspired by a TikTok I saw, that I believe was inspired by or at least very similar to deathroll from World of Warcraft, and drinking games like King's Cup.

## How to Play

Go to [deathroll](https://dreader0.github.io/deathroll).
Click the big red button! A random number between 1 and 9999 will be rolled, and a random rule will be selected (unless the new number has a special assigned rule). 
The rolled number will be the new max the next time you roll. Follow the rule and roll again.
The game ends when someone rolls a skull. The original idea was for the loser to take a shot, but feel free to come up with your own punishments for the loser.
Click the button again to start over.

## It's not finished

deathroll is still in development and it's definitely not perfect at the moment. Please forgive us if you run into any bugs or issues.
For example: if you click the button repeatedly too quickly, the game will most likely break and the button will get stuck on the death screen, so take it easy.
