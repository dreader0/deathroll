# deathroll

deathroll is a fast-paced and easy to pick up drinking game inspired by deathroll from World of Warcraft and drinking games like King's Cup.

## How to Play

Go to [deathroll](https://dreader0.github.io/deathroll).
Click the big red button! A random number between 1 and 9999 will be rolled, and a random rule will be selected (unless the new number has a special assigned rule). 
The rolled number will be the new max the next time you roll. Follow the rule and roll again.
The game ends when someone rolls a 1, and they take a shot!
Click the button again to start over.

## It's not finished

deathroll is still in development and it's definitely not perfect at the moment. Please forgive us if you run into any bugs or issues.
For example: if you click the button repeatedly too quickly, the game will most likely break and the button will get stuck on the death screen, so take it easy.

## Future Plans

We want to implement more features as soon as possible:
  - Rule explanations
  - Players
  - Multiple rulesets
  - & More!
